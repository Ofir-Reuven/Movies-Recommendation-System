# Movies-Recommendation-System
Movies recommendation system based on previously watched movies

## Requirements
This program requires <b>Pandas</b>, <b>Numpy</b> and <b>Sklearn</b> installed in order to use it.

## Dataset
This program uses <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata?resource=download"> TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset</a> instead of a large dataset to reduce weight.<br> Hence, there are lots of movies which don't  exist in the dataset and won't work when you try to find movies  similar to them.
